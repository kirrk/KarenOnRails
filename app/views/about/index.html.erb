<div class="about">
<p>Based out of Seattle, WA, I am a freelance web developer / designer who offers an array of services including web development, print design, and even copy editing and creative writing.

As a geeky lady (and ex-journalist) who emancipated herself from the dying world of journalism, I pride myself on hard work, being a self-starter and continuously striving to improve my skills. </p>

<p>With web development, often comes the demand for deft problem solving skills and a keen sense of attention to detail. In web and life for that matter, there is endless learning to do along with endless ways to make a difference in this world. To do either, whether in work or life, you must be a doer.  And perhaps in no field more than web development. </p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy freelancing, strumming guitar, volunteering, and spending time with friends.</p>

<p>-Karen Kirr</p>
